    "So far we have only considerd variables which hold a singular value. It will often be the case that you want to do the same operation on a collection of values, or store related values together in a data structure. Lists are the simpelest way of accheiving both these tasks. However, in time you will come to have better ways to do both these things using Arrays (numpy) and Dictionaries (built in python). We use python lists and ranges to teach here for a few reasons:\n",
