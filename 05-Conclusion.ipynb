To do this open your favourite text editor (or IDE) and create a new file that is called somthing line `my_file_name.py` the `.py` specifys its python you can then run this using a terminal search terminal on Mac or see WSL on windows. When you are in the terminal use the command `python path/to/my_file_name.py`. If you dont understand that seach out a bash/shell/terminal course (coming soon...).\n",
