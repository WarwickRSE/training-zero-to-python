    "\n",
    "List comprehensions are an excellent way to make your code look neater and run faster. \n",

    "```python\n",
    "my_simple_listcomp = [ i for i in range(1,101) ]\n",
    "#                      ^\n",
    "#                   This is the value the list element will take.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to see this as a mixture of a for loop and a list. The `for` loop iterates over `range(1,101)`, each time it assigns the value to the variable `i`. In this list comprehension we don't do anything with the variable `i`, so the value of `i` becomes the list value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing a simple conditional we can filter the values. To create a list of only even numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "evens_only = [ i for i in range(1,101) if i%2==0 ]\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The filter prevents that element being added to the list, so this list is only 50 elements long.\n",
