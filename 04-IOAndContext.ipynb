    "`open` is python function that takes two arguments. The `path` (fancy word for location) of a file, and the `mode`, which is the way in which you want to open the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here our path was just the name of the file, `lorem_ipusm.txt`, as the file is in the same folder this notebook is in. We used the mode `r` which means read. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then assign the result of `open` to the variable `f`. The result of open is a `stream`**. What exactly this is isn't that important right now, but what we can do with it is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "`f.read()` returns the entire content of the file as a string, and we assign this string to a variable `file contents`. Then we print that to output with `print(file_contents)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly and this is very important, we do `f.close()` this closes the file and deactivates the stream. If we run any other commands on the stream python will rase an error that the file has been closed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do all this just to open a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our file may be very large, in fact it may be gigabytes of memory. We want to be able to open it, search it, and close it. During the time it is open it will be using our computers resources. We want to extract the information we need and close it to regain these resources. Thus using `f.read()` is only common for smaller files as otherwise we simply have a massive string stored in memory. \n",

A side note that opening a file in this way has it's uses especially via the [stream methods](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_file.asp), of which `f.read()` is one. However, in most cases there will be a simpler way of loading your data, but that is out of scope of this course*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code is going to open the file as before, but instead of using `f.read` which transfers the entire content of the file to a variable, we will use a `for` loop with our stream. This should give you a hint as to a property of `f`; `f` can also be an iterable that when looped over returns one line of the file at a time. For a file with many many lines, such as a datafile from an experiment, this is much more memory efficient*. Within the for loop we can summarize the data and print the data summary.\n",
