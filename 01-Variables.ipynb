    "In Python everything is an Object. These objects are stored in computer memory. A variable is really a 'pointer', or address, to the memory that stores that object. When you use the variable it goes to that memory address picks up the object and does some work to figure out what that object is and how it should proceed. In most cases this is simple, it goes to the memory figures out its looking at a number then can do 'number things' with that number. However, as anything is an object and anything can thus be assigned to a variable we can use variables to store (or point at) anything in Python. In Python we find functions, classes, iterators, dictonaries... these can all be assigned to a variable. This gives an enormous amount of flexibility to python, **however**, just because you can dosen't mean you should. It's also worth noting if you come from a C background a python variable will act like a pointer or a value depending on the object type, and this gets worse when you use libraries which may for good reason break with the built-in data types.\n",
