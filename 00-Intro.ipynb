    "- How to run lines of python.\n",
    "- The basic Python data types.\n",
    "- How to use Lists and Loops.\n",
    "- How to write functions.\n",

    "- `notebook` this is what you are looking at. They are designed to have code and explanation together, and they are made of cells.\n",
    "- `cell`s are the boxes where these notes are and also where the code is.\n",
    "- `code` is the text, symbols and numbers in one of these cells.\n",
    "- `dropdowns` There is an example below, these are extra information, clarification, hints, or answers. They are totally optional. If any contain really confusing topics they will have a skip warning. \n",

    "### Is this top quality programming?\n",
    "Short answer no. Really good programming is hard, takes years of practice, and is a full time job. Some of the code in these notebooks is simply bad, but, it is designed to be readable and develop your skills. The examples and challenges will try to build you to a point where you can read and write basic python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where strictly bad practices are required, because we haven't yet covered what we need to maintain good practice, this will be noted. Where simplifications or over generalizations are made there will be a dropdown with further explanation. Those dropdowns are designed for completeness without overwhelming you with unnecessary details - they do not need to be read/understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology \n",
    "This is a hands on learning course. As much as possible you will be asked to copy, modify, and write code. **You will get things wrong**, this is fine. Simply re-write the code and try again. For any challenges you get stuck on you can look at the provided hints. The hints are ordered from a nudge to a fill in the blanks solution. There is nothing wrong with needing the fill in the blanks solution, but if you use them try doing the challenge again in a few days without looking at the hints.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outcomes\n",
    "Once you have finished this course you will not be a scientific programmer. What you will have is a foundation for other courses that will be geared to solving real problems. Or be able to more confidently tackle an 'intro to' lecture course where topics and ideas may assume you have some base understanding of python. \n",
